## Summary
- Restored Raed logic baseline and layered DeepSeek visual tokens across header, hero, product blocks, and footer.
- Replaced project metadata, documentation, and tooling references with NEEDSBOXES equivalents.
- Added comprehensive audit + verification docs to close the rebranding cycle.

## Completed

- ✅ Localization audit (AR/EN)
- ✅ Documentation refresh (README, tracker, audit, checklist, changelog)

## QA Notes

- `salla theme preview` executed successfully via https://salla.design/dev-mgtzxcqjxhzjvoan (expires per token); continue manual route verification there.

## Next Actions

2. Monitor for any regressions reported by stakeholders post-preview publish.
